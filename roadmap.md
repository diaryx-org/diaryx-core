# Roadmap

## v0.11.0

### Template support for web frontend

### Export different file types

Possibly embed pandoc?

### Improved Sync/Backup

### Cross-platform import

Import from Obsidian (add all part_of/contents properties + index files)

## Other considerations

### Better documentation

~~We have just one README file right now.~~ Working on it!

### Undo/redo

I would like `diaryx undo` and `diaryx redo` commands to undo/redo any command that was previously done, because it is easy to make mistakes.

### Encryption

Ideally hot-swappable similar to backup backends. Maybe Cryptomator?

### Math/diagrams

TipTap has an extension for LaTeX, but I would like to support Mermaid diagrams and Typst syntax as well. Maybe there is a way to swap parsers and return an image?
