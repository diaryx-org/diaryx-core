# Important!

Please read the root README.md file for an overview of the codebase.

# Other instructions for AI agents

If a user makes a request that requires knowledge of the codebase, please read the linked README files for each crate and app to understand the codebase, and then read the code for more specific information. Update the README files to reflect any changes you make.

Because Diaryx is currently in alpha state, good codebase design is more important than backwards compatibility. Don't hesitate to suggest breaking changes if they would improve the codebase's design, reduce code duplication, or otherwise improve the codebase's maintainability.
